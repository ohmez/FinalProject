what's expected for the project:

Whatever you build should have utility.

you should have market or real-world research that proves their idea has REAL value to people.

you should perform research on other web / mobile applications in their app's domain.

you should put serious time and thought into this.

you should report problems they're facing along the way.

you should use some form of project management system (Jira, Trello and so on).

you should dig deep into documentation and external resources to find the tools they need.

Finally, go over each week's deliverable

Week 1: A detailed plan of action with the following:

An overview of the intended application and WHY you feel it's valuable.

A breakdown of roles by group member.

A schedule for completion of various tasks.

A screenshot of your Jira, Trello, or Project Management Board that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members with a schedule.

A set of DETAILED screen-by-screen design layouts with annotations describing all UI/UX components and all data relevant to the screen.

On this note, show Slides 26-27 as an example of a UI/UX and Data Flow layout. Tell the class that you'll expect something akin to these drafts.
Week 2: A functioning minimal viable product (i.e., a prototype version of your app that shows the intended function). This should be as close to a working app as possible and include:

A 5-7 minute presentation that discusses what your app is, what it does, and how it works. You will be presenting to instructors and TAs during class.

A screenshot of your Jira, Trello, or Project Management Board that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members with a schedule. This should be updated to reflect remaining priorities and completed tasks.

Week 3: A significantly more polished version of the app.

This should literally seem like an app that you would submit.

Include a summary of significant issues faced to date and their resolution.

Provide a detailed description of each person's contributions.

Submit a detailed plan that describes remaining efforts. This should describe remaining issues like:

Stretch Features
Bugs
Enhancements
UI Polishing
Week 4: The Presentation!

A 7-10 minute demonstration of your app.
